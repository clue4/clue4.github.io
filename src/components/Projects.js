            something to help. This idea became more generalized (and infused with a healthy dose of capitalism), and we created a 
            map-based program that enables users to sell/otherwise exchange items to promote community involvement and help each other. 
            I specifically worked on the map interface, using HTML, CSS, and JS for this project."

            a moodboard/bullet journal idea where people can track their moods every day on a monthly basis and log their
            thoughts. So far, I've used HTML, CSS, and a bit of JS for this project."
